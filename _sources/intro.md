# Compumag TEAM-problems

The international Compumag Societey provides a
set of problems for Testing Electromagnetic Analsysi Methods (TEAM),
well known as [TEAM problems](https://www.compumag.org/wp/team/).

This repository collects solutions obtained from simulations with the open source
finite element tool [Netgen/NGSolve](ngsolve.org)


This website is generated from executing a set of ipython notebooks by the jupyter tool family.

The NGSolve software and additional packages can by easily installed for the
Python system using 

    python -m pip ngsolve jupyter numpy scipy matplotlib


The models were setup jointly by the NGSolve-team lead by Joachim Schöberl (TU Wien)
and Chrisopher Lackner (CERBSim GmbH), with a leading role taken by
Valentin Hanser (TU Wien). Significant contributions by Karl Hollaus, Michael Leumüller
and Markus Schöbinger (TU Wien) and Matthias Hochsteger (CERBSim GmbH) are acknowledged.
